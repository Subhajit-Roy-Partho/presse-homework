### Q1. Stochastic binary decisions

Gillespieâ€™s algorithm is used to solve these problem.

#### **Differnetial Rate Equations:**


dA1*/dt = k3.E.A1 .... [1]

dA1/dt = -k3.A1.E - A1.k5.S ..... [2]

dE/dt = k1.A1 +k4.A1* -kd.E ..... [3]

dS/dt = k2.A2 -kd.S .... [4]

Also k1=k2=k4=kd=1 and k3=100 and k5=100.

Looking at the above equation the rate of A1* is dependant upon the concentration of E and A1. Also the rate is always increasing and there is no destruction. Thus one expect a monotoneously increasing value of A1*. Also we expect a rapid growth of E at the begining as only -kd.E contribute to its destruction and should be low at the begining. Thus we expect a very large growth rate at the beginning but soon the rate is expected to drop as the concentration of A1 would deplete fast with the growth of S and E. We observe a similar situation in the grah.

Also we expect to observer a case where there is no growth of A1* if A1 decreases very rapidly. Then the concentration of E will reduce as well the A1 and we expect to observer almost no growth in the value of A1*. This is the numerical instability of the problem. Thuse we expect a constant value for the A1* or almost 0 very soon the simulation ater the begining of the simulation.

### **CASE-2**

*Very high value of A1 and A2*
